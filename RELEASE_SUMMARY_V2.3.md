## 💬 User Confirmation

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Event Handling Patterns:**
   - One-shot tools need early return + is_drawing check
   - Continuous tools need motion event handling

2. **Display Update Strategy:**
   - queue_redraw() for UI state changes
   - mark_display_dirty() for pixel changes
   - composite_cache = null for explicit invalidation

3. **Code Path Parity:**
   - Custom path and fallback path must have identical side effects
   - Missing mark_display_dirty() caused Bug #7

4. **Debug Effectiveness:**
   - Comprehensive logging with tags ([DRAW], [PIXEL], [CACHE]) revealed execution flow
   - Console output analysis was key to finding root causes

5. **Iterative Testing:**
   - User feedback after each fix accelerated debugging
   - 7 test cycles identified all issues
